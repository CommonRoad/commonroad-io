    "    * A **LaneletNetwork** is built from lane segments (**Lanelet**), that can be connected arbitrarily.\n",
    "* A **PlanningProblemSet** contains one **PlanningProblem** for every ego vehicle in the **Scenario**, consisting of an **initial position** and a **GoalRegion** that has to be reached."
