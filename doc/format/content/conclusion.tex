\section{Conclusions}

The \textit{CommonRoad} format is a platform-independent format for specifying road traffic scenarios for motion planning. 
Complex traffic situations can be encoded by specifying the road network, static and dynamic obstacles, and the planning problem. 
Details on models for the ego vehicle dynamics can be found in the \textit{vehicle model documentation}. Examples of traffic situations that are specified by this format can be found on the \textit{CommonRoad} website\footnote{\href{https://commonroad.in.tum.de}{commonroad.in.tum.de}}.
