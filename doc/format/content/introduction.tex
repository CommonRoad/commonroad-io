\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\subsection{Overview about CommonRoad}
Within \textit{CommonRoad}\cite{Althoff2017a}\footnote{\href{https://commonroad.in.tum.de}{commonroad.in.tum.de}}, Protocol Buffers\footnote{https://protobuf.dev/} and XML files (currently only up to version 2020a) are used to store the data for specific driving scenarios. 
In this documentation, we present the definition of CommonRoad scenarios, which are composed of (1) meta information describing the scenario (see Section~\ref{subsec:meta}), (2) a formal representation of the road network (see Section~\ref{subsec:lanelets}-\ref{subsec:intersections}), (3) static and dynamic obstacles (see Section~\ref{subsec:obstacles}), and (4) the planning problem of the ego vehicle(s) (see Section~\ref{subsec:egoVehicles}). 
In non-collaborative scenarios, only one planning problem exists, while in collaborating scenarios several planning problems have to be solved.

A visualization of all scenarios is on our website\footnote{\href{https://commonroad.in.tum.de/scenarios/}{commonroad.in.tum.de/scenarios}}, where you can also search for specific types of scenarios.

Since CommonRoad version 2023a, the default representation of a CommonRoad scenario consists of three Protobuf files instead of a  single (Protobuf/XML) file.
However, for a better exchange of files it is possible to write and read all information in just one file.


\subsection{Changes Compared to Version 2020a}

For a quick reference, we summarize the major changes of version 2023a compared to version 2020a:
\begin{itemize}
\item New intersection definition
\item Separation into three files: map, dynamic, scenario 
\item Additional elements for link to licenses and license text
\item Area for modelling parking lots, bus stops, or any other "drivable area" which is difficult to model via lanelets (concept derived from lanelet2 format)
\item Meta-information series for obstacles
\item Boundary definition separated from lanelet 
\end{itemize}
