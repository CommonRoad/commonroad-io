Numerical experiments for motion planning of road vehicles require numerous ingredients: vehicle dynamics, 
a road network, static obstacles, dynamic obstacles and their movement over time, goal regions, a cost function, etc. 
Providing a description of the numerical experiment precise enough to reproduce it might require several pages of 
information. 
Thus, only key aspects are typically described in scientific publications, making it impossible to reproduce 
results - yet, reproducibility is an important asset of good science.

Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads (CommonRoad) are proposed so that numerical experiments are fully 
defined by a unique ID; all required information to reconstruct the experiment can be found on [commonroad.in.tum.de](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/).
Each benchmark is composed of a [vehicle model](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-vehicle-models/blob/master/vehicleModels_commonRoad.pdf), 
a [cost function](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-cost-functions/blob/master/costFunctions_commonRoad.pdf), 
and a [scenario](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/scenarios/) (including goals and constraints). 
The scenarios are partly recorded from real traffic and partly hand-crafted to create dangerous situations. 
Solutions to the benchmarks can be uploaded and ranked on the CommonRoad Website.
Learn more about the scenario specification [here](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-scenarios/blob/master/documentation/XML_commonRoad_2020a.pdf).

# commonroad-io

The commonroad-io package provides methods to read, write, and visualize CommonRoad scenarios and planning problems. Furthermore, it can be used as a framework for implementing motion planning algorithms to solve CommonRoad Benchmarks and is the basis for other tools of the CommonRoad Framework.
With commonroad-io, those solutions can be written to xml-files for uploading them on [commonroad.in.tum.de](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/).

commonroad-io 2023.4 is compatible with CommonRoad scenarios in version 2020a and supports reading 2018b scenarios.

The software is written in Python and tested on Linux for the Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.


## Documentation

The full documentation of the API and introducing examples can be found under [commonroad.in.tum.de](https://commonroad-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For getting started, we recommend our [tutorials](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/commonroad-io).

## Additional Tools
Based on commonroad-io, we have developed a list of tools supporting the development of motion-planning algorithms:

* [Drivability Checker](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/drivability-checker)
* [CommonRoad-SUMO Interface](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/sumo-interface)
* [Scenario Designer](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/scenario-designer)
* [Vehicle Models](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/model-cost-functions)
* [Dateset Converters](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/dataset-converters)
* [Interactive Scenarios](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-interactive-scenarios)
* [Apollo Interface](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-apollo-interface)

## Requirements

The required dependencies for running commonroad-io are:

* numpy>=1.13
* scipy>=1.5.2
* shapely>=2.0.1
* matplotlib>=2.2.2
* lxml>=4.2.2
* networkx>=2.2
* Pillow>=7.0.0
* commonroad-vehicle-models>=2.0.0
